      <h5><u>HOW TO PLAY</u></h5>

      You move pieces by dragging them. A piece slide until it hit something.
      If it slides out of the game the level is abandoned. If a piece has a
      circle around it it can't be moved.<br><br>

        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/green.gif">
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/blue.gif">
      </center><br>

      The goal of the game is to get
      rid of all stones (red, green, blue, black, yellow).  If certain
      stones collide in certain ways they both dissapear. The following
      moves causes the involved stones to dissapear:<br>
      <blockquote>
      	A red stone dragged to a green.<br>
      	A green stone dragged to a blue.<br>
      	A blue stone dragged to a red.<br>
      	(note the circularity)<br>
      </blockquote>

        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/black.gif">
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/yellow.gif">
      </center><br>

      <blockquote>
      	A black stone dragged to any other stone.<br>
      	Any stone(exept yellow) dragged to a yellow<br>
      	(note the hierarcy)<br>
      </blockquote>

      If stones collide in any other way the dragged stone just stops.  (wich
      will show essential to the game later).<br> If a red is dragged on a row
      of green they all will dissapear, the domino effect. the same holds for
      a black dragged to a row of stones in all colours.<br> The above
      described is the only way of getting rid of stones.<br>

      Observe: With stones is meant only the red, green, blue, green, black,
      yellow. The others are called pieces.<br> Now you know enough to play
      the level called tutorial. Do that.<br>

      </center><br>

      The all gray piece is the boring guy around here. It is used to stack
      other pieces on. (you stack stones on stones to, if they are stacked in
      the right order)<br>

      <center>
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/teleport.gif">
      </center><br>

      The piece with a lightning is a teleporter, they work in pairs
      only. If something enter one of them it exits the other with unchanged
      direction. If you drag one teleporter to the other it just continues
      right through it.<br>

      <center>
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/colcykle.gif">
      </center><br>

      The piece that looks like small red, green, blue stones cykles
      the colour of red, green and blue stones.<br>

      <center>
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/arrow.gif">
      </center><br>

      The piece with straight arrows on it only let pieces through
      in the direction of the arrow.<br>

      <center>
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/dircykle.gif">
      </center><br>

      The piece with a circular arrow on it changes the direction of things
      that go through it.<br>

      <center>
        <img width=32 height=32 src="gif/death.gif">
      </center><br>

      The skull abandones the level when something is dragged to
      it.<br><br>

      That might have seemed awfully complicated; it really isn't!<br>
      Just play around a while and you'll get the point. The most
      important thing to learn is the order of the red - green - blue
      stones.<br><br>

      Good Luck!
